# Background
We form part of a small group of data scientists who develop various models for companies and businesses who are looking to expand their knowledge in this field, but who currently are still outsourcing these activities instead of having a fully fledged in house team of people doing this for them, or who are in the process of developing their own in house capabilities.

# The Ask
The newly formed data science team from one of our clients have asked us to do an independent model development and buid by making use of the same underlying dataset which they have used in order for them to do a review and establish whether their inhouse developed model and approach (steps) are soundThe client has not been prescriptive regarding certain criteria, but has given us some guidelines for us to check against as we build out our model.

The main aim of the model is to classify whether a customer will take up the sales offer or not when we cold call them, so the better we discriminate between who will be more likely to take up the offer and who will not, can help our client to better optimise their internal efforts in terms of cold calling the right customer in order to convert those calls to sales.

The secondary aim, is to overlay the revenue / cost impacts based on our classification outcomes, in order to evaluate what the estimated impact will be on the financials by executing campaigns using this model for selection purposes and what it will yield and cost us.
